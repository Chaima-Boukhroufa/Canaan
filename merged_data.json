Under the new law, the formation of an association is not conditioned on prior authorization, but the new association is required to notify the authorities and may not “aim to undermine public order or territorial integrity, to change the current form of government, or to politically detach the various nationalities of the Empire from the State.” “Political associations borrowing their object and title from a race or nationality” are prohibited.",

The society has only 60 members until the end of World War I\n\n, because a series of tough probation steps is followed for admission of a new member before being sworn in, so much so that the organization's existence is kept secret until after the Ottoman forces withdraw from the Arab provinces in 1918. Members will play a prominent role in the preparations for the First Arab Congress\n\n\n in Paris in June 1913 and in the run-up to the 1916 Great Arab Revolt\n\n\n, and they will emerge as Prince Faisal\n\n\n’s aides with the establishment of Arab rule in Damascus in the fall of 1918.",

      "description": "The clashes occur first among Jews in Tel Aviv\n\n celebrating the \"First of May\": a group of communists calling for \"international solidarity of the Jewish and Arab proletariat\" and heading from the outskirts of Jaffa\n\n\n toward Tel Aviv collide with the main demonstration by the Zionist Labour movement. Tension mounts between Palestinian and Jewish demonstrators, and then confrontation spreads rapidly. Three days of clashes result in the death of 43 Jews and 14 Palestinians. On 5 and 6 May, the explosive situation reaches Petah Tikva\n\n, al-Yahudiyya\n\n\n (renamed al-Abbasiyya\n\n\n in 1932), and Hadera\n\n, causing the death of 4 Jews and 54 Palestinians (for the latter, mainly due to the intervention of the British military). On 7 May, High Commissioner Herbert Samuel\n\n appoints Palestine Chief Justice Thomas Haycraft\n\n to head a commission of inquiry into the disturbances.",

The line, which runs from Rafah on the Mediterranean Sea\n\n to Taba\n\n\n on the Red Sea\n\n, is not formally considered as an international frontier, since Egypt, though under British control, is nominally part of the Ottoman Empire\n\n.

In 1919, the British controlling both Palestine and Egypt will adopt the line demarcated in 1906 as the frontier between the two territories.",

In contrast to France\n\n’s mandate over Syria\n\n\n, the text on Palestine does not request from the mandatory power the enactment, within three years, of an \"organic law\" in agreement with \"the native authorities\", but gives the British \"full powers of legislation and of administration\" . It reiterates, in particular, Britain’s commitment to the Zionist project as phrased in the Balfour Declaration\n\n (article 2). It also decides that an “appropriate Jewish agency shall be recognized as a public body for the purpose of advising and cooperating” with the Mandatory Power in matters related to the establishment of the Jewish National Home and specifies that the Zionist Organization\n\n will be considered as such agency and requests it to secure the cooperation of all Jews who are willing to assist in the establishment of the Jewish National Home (article 4). The document authorizes the Mandatory power, subject to the League’s consent, to withhold the application of some of its provisions, in the territory east of the Jordan River\n\n\n (article 25). An accompanying resolution of the council stipulates that the mandates for Palestine and Syria will enter into force, automatically and at the same time, as soon as France and Italy\n\n sign an agreement resolving particular points related to France’s mandate over Syria.",

On 23 December, a Frenco-British Convention confirms the Syria\n\n\n–Transjordan border. The British themselves do not wish to expand the administration of Palestine across Transjordan, though High Commissioner Herbert Samuel\n\n advocates for the expansion, in an attempt to include the territory within the Jewish National Home. The British send political officers to encourage localized self-government in the three districts (Irbid\n\n\n, al-Salt\n\n\n, and al-Karak\n\n\n) that constitute Transjordanian territory. But within several months, it appears that there is no substitute to establishing a central administration. Emir Abdullah\n\n\n arrives in Ma'an\n\n\n on 21 November, coming from the Hijaz\n\n\n, ostensibly to support exiled Syrian officers in their struggle against the French.",

Festivities start with a procession in Jerusalem on the Friday preceding the Christian Orthodox Good Friday (which, in 1920, fall respectively on 2 and 9 April) and last for 7 days, during which worshippers come from different towns (such as Hebron and Jaffa) to join the Jerusalemites heading to Nabi Musa shrines south of Jericho. The procession on 2 April passes off without incident and meets peacefully with another Christian procession to commemorate Catholic Good Friday, which happens to fall this year on this day. On 4 April, Zionist youth provoke Palestinian participants, triggering violent clashes that will end 3 days later and will cause the death of 5 Jews and 4 Palestinians and the injury of more than 200 Jews and 21 Palestinians. The violence of the confrontation occurs against the backdrop of Palestinians mobilized against the threatening implementation of the Balfour Declaration and impacted by the proclamation (3 March) of Syria’s independence under Faisal. Between 60,000 and 70,000 participate in the festival compared to an average of 15,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. On 6 April, Jerusalem notables accuse the Zionist Commission of being “a government within a government” and of training and arming the Jews in Palestine.",

The society declares that it welcomes Arabs of all creeds to join it, and it decides to establish branches throughout the Arab provinces. At the end of April 1909, shortly after retaking control of Istanbul following a 10-day counterrevolution (13-24 April), the CUP government closes the society, under the pretext of its support for the counterrevolution. The move to shut down the Arab-Ottoman Brotherhood Society and other non-Turkish associations indicates the Young Turks\n\n movement's fear of the rising calls for decentralized governance in Arab and other non-Turkish provinces.",

      "description": "General Edmund Allenby\n\n launches the Third Gaza Battle\n\n (after the failure of the two previous ones in March and April). The military campaign starts with the capture of Bir al-Sabi'\n\n\n on 31 October, immediately followed by the fight for Gaza\n and the Gaza-Bir al-Sabi' defensive line held by the Ottoman forces (1–7 November). The British occupy the village of al-Maghar\n\n\n (13–14 November), west of the railway station where the line from Jerusalem\n\n\n joins the north–south line. On 15–16 November, they occupy Ramla\n\n\n, Lydda\n\n\n, Jaffa\n\n\n, and al-Latrun\n\n\n. To conquer Jerusalem, British forces try to force the Ottomans to leave the city by cutting roads leading to it and attempt to advance along two main axes: from al-Latrun to the north of Jerusalem (passing by Imwas\n\n\n, Bayt 'Ur al-Fawqa\n\n\n, and Nabi Samu'il\n\n\n); from Bir al-Sabi' to the south of the city (through Hebron\n\n\n and Bethlehem\n\n\n). Ottoman counterattacks delay British advances on several fronts from mid-November to the first week of December when the Ottomans decide to evacuate the city. They leave on 8-9 December after the Ottoman Mutasarrif signs the surrender letter of the city and transmits it to the mayor of Jerusalem, Hussein Salim al-Husseini\n\n\n, for delivery to the British.",

It states that the Declaration does not contemplate that Palestine \"as a whole\" should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded \"in Palestine.\" However, it affirms that Jews are in Palestine \"as of right and not on the sufferance\" and explains that the British commitment to the Jewish national home entails that the Jewish community in Palestine should be able to increase its numbers by immigration. In order to respond to the Palestinian delegation's assertion that British/ McMahon\n pledges concerning Arab independence include Palestine, the White Paper, in its defense of the Balfour Declaration, claims (falsely) that the exclusions indicated by McMahon to Sharif Hussein\n concerned \"the Vilayet of Beirut\n and the independent Sanjaq of Jerusalem\n\n\n\" and that \"the whole of Palestine west of the Jordan\n was thus excluded from Sir. Henry McMahon's pledge.\"",

The speech, which occurs nine weeks after the Balfour Declaration\n\n (which Wilson had secretly endorsed in mid-October 1917 before it was announced on 2 November), is due in part to the Bolsheviks’ disclosure (on 23 November 1917) of the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement\n\n. Wilson summarizes his peace principles in 14 points, condemns secret understandings between states, and advocates peoples’ right to self-determination (though he does not use this expression literally in his speech). Concerning the Ottoman Empire\n\n, he states: “the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development.” Analysts and historians will note the incompatibility between Wilson’s points and his endorsement of the terms of the Balfour Declaration.",

Haganah is placed first under the auspices of the Histadrut\n\n.

Within the same month, Baron Edmond de Rothschild\n\n tenders an offer for about a million dunams at Baysan\n\n\n.

The ordinance is published in the Palestine Gazette on 15 December 1920.
